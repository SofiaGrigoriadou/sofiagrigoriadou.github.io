I am a final year Biomedical Sciences undergraduate student, currently searching a research facility to perform a 12-month traineeship (obligatory to complete my degree), funded by Erasmus+ grants.

Under the guidance of Prof. Tsamesidis Ioannis, I completed my undergraduate thesis titled "**Effects of *Achillea millefolium* on the physiology of red blood cells and platelets**". My research enabled me to gain significant experience in handling and analyzing blood samples, and the subsequent results.

I am also interested in bringing science to the everyday person, which was the inspiration behing "The Biomedicals", a blog and social media channels, aiming to make biology accessible - to everyone.

## Selected Experience


# 🔬 Research Experience Example

My research experience comes from the experiments I run and the protocols I build as part of my udergraduate thesis.

I have experience in wet lab techniques in the field of haematology; namely, preparation of blood samples, performing hemocompatibility assays and osmotic fragility tests, preparation and observation of microscope slides, and testing blood coagulation time.


# 📚 Teaching Experience Example

I run "The Biomedicals", a blog and social media channels aimed to help bridge the gap between researchers and the general public.

Additionally, I provide private tutoring to high-school students on the subjects of Biology, Haematology, and Immunology.
