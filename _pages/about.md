I am a final year Biomedical Sciences undergraduate student, searching a research facility to perform an internship, funded by Erasmus+ after-placement grants, starting by May 2026.

Starting December 2025 to April 2026, I am an intern at ["Theagenio" Anticancer Hospital of Thessaloniki](https://theageneio.gov.gr/el/), rotating the hospital's Hematology, Biochemistry, Pathology, Biopathology, Cytology, and Blood Donation Departments.

Under the guidance of Dr. Tsamesidis Ioannis, I completed my undergraduate thesis on an intersection of hematology and botany, titled "**Effects of *Achillea millefolium* on the physiology of red blood cells and platelets**". My research enabled me to gain significant experience in handling and analyzing blood samples, and the subsequent results.

My skills cover wet and dry lab, as a result of my coursework and my thesis. My achievements in education, my work experience, along with my above professional working proficiency in three languages and my attendances at various workshops and conferences portray a person adaptive in diverse environments, with drive to learn and excel independently or in an intercultural team.



## Selected Experience


# 🔬 Research Experience

My research experience comes from the experiments I run and the protocols I build as part of my undergraduate thesis, as well as my time as Research Assistant.

I have experience in wet lab techniques in the field of haematology; namely, preparation of blood samples, performing hemocompatibility assays and osmotic fragility tests, preparation and observation of microscope slides, and testing blood coagulation time.
