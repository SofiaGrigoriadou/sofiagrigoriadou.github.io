I am a final year Biomedical Sciences undergraduate student, currently searching a research facility to perform a 12-month traineeship (obligatory to complete my degree), funded by Erasmus+ grants.

Under the guidance of Dr. Tsamesidis Ioannis, I completed my undergraduate thesis on an intersection of hematology and botany, titled "**Effects of *Achillea millefolium* on the physiology of red blood cells and platelets**". My research enabled me to gain significant experience in handling and analyzing blood samples, and the subsequent results.

I am also interested in bringing science to the everyday person, which was the inspiration behing "The Biomedicals", a [blog](https://thebiomedicals.com) and social media channels, aiming to make biology accessible - to everyone.

My skills cover wet and dry lab, as a result of my coursework and my thesis. My achievements in education, my work experience, along with my above professional working proficiency in three languages and my attendances at various workshops and conferences portray a person adaptive in diverse environments, with drive to learn and excel independently or in an intercultural team.



## Selected Experience


# ðŸ”¬ Research Experience

My research experience comes from the experiments I run and the protocols I build as part of my udergraduate thesis.

I have experience in wet lab techniques in the field of haematology; namely, preparation of blood samples, performing hemocompatibility assays and osmotic fragility tests, preparation and observation of microscope slides, and testing blood coagulation time.


# ðŸ“š Teaching Experience

I run "The Biomedicals", a blog and social media channels aimed to help bridge the gap between researchers and the general public.

Additionally, I provide private tutoring to high-school students on the subjects of Biology, Haematology, and Immunology.
