My Bachelor's thesis research project on the widely-used plant *Achillea millefolium* (yarrow) and its effects on human blood and coagulation.

**Abstract**

Achillea millefolium is a medical plant that has been used for millennia to treat hemorrhage and open wounds, based on folkloric evidence of amelioration of coagulation time and healing properties. Multiple studies have been conducted to examine this matter, but few focus on the red blood cells. The object of this study was to investigate the effects of a methanolic extract from Achillea millefolium on the physiology and morphology of normal red blood cells.
